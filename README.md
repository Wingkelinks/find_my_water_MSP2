# Find My Water Australia

###### Code Institute MS2 / Interactive Front-End Development

An interactive and responsive, multi-page website with the primary function of enabling users to search and locate existing tidal/ocean pools in and around Australia.

## UX

### Target audiences include:

- Australian residents with a specific interest in exploring the country's ocean/tidal pools.
- People with general swimming interests.
- People that enjoy being active outdoors. 
- International and local travellers, with an interest in exploring Australia's ocean/tidal pools.

### External User goals:

- To search for popular ocean/tidal pools, by location.
- Get directions to locations. 
- Compile an itinery/list of desired locations.
- Access to previously saved searches/itineries (login/profile function).
- Access to external links offering further information on those locations.
- Access to images of some of the locations. 
- Ability to contribute data, by suggesting locations not yet listed (by email).
- Ability to leave comments/reviews on locations users have visited. 

### Developer and Site Owner goals:

- To provide a niche service to users around a topic the developer has a personal interest in. 
- To showcase Australia's iconic and lesser-known ocean/tidal pools. 
- To build a visually appealing website, that offers practical and interesting functionality.
- To initiate an idea that could potentially lead to a real world project at a later stage in the developer's career.

### 1. Strategy

The primary purpose of the website is to build an attractive and functional site that offers users a specific service and experience. 

### 2. Scope

**Minimum Viable Product** for the website will include:

- home page - with an underwater video as a background.
- about page - offering information about the site's purpose. 
- map page - integrated google maps API allowing users to perform searches and visualise their saved locations in the form of a table/list. 
- top locations page - gallery of a few popular locations.
- contact page - with a form, that will allow users to send an email directly to the site owner to ask any questions they may have. 

**Desirable features** at a later stage may include:

- a newsletter/sign up feature
- an account/login feature - allowing users to save searches and create a user profile. 

### 3. Structure

## User Stories

**User interviews/research:**

1. As a user, would you like to have access to a website that enables you to search for tidal/saltwater pools in Australia?

   > Yes.

2. If yes, what features/content would you like the website to have and why?

> - Map function to search for locations and get directions
> - To select/save favourite locations 
> - Access to external information/links
> - To view images of locations 

3. Would you expect the website to offer further info related to the topic of natural/outdoor swimming in Australia? If yes, what type of information?

   > Yes, access to any other relevant external links, articles or news features. 

4. What type of device would you normally use to perform the above tasks?

   > Mobile and desktop.

## User Story Testing

**User interviews post deployment:**

> - Testing still to come... 

### 4. Skeleton

- Wireframes showing layout and responsive design: [Wireframes]()

### 5. Surface

- The **tidal/ocean pool theme** stems from the developer's own desire to travel Australia's coastline and explore it's famous and lesser known coastal swimming spots. As a swimmer and ocean admirer, the developer also intends to convey the beauty and meditative qualities that can be linked to water. 

- **Images and media** obtained from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) and [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/). 

- **Strong water/ocean theme** inspired a matching colour pallete, i.e. variations of blues in conjunction with complimentary and triadic colours including, oranges, pinks and greens. 
[Coolors](https://coolors.co/) was used to create a pallete by sampling colors from an image used in the website. 

- For **font selection** [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used. A variety of fonts were tested before settling on "Bungee Shade" as a leading font, which is paired with "Pangolin" as a sub-font. The 'outlined' design on Bungee Shade provides strong contrast against the movement of the water video on the home page. 

- [Google Fonts: Material Icons](https://fonts.google.com/icons) were used to implement the 'map marker' that accompanies the title in the navbar and home page. This icon was chosen not only for it's reference to mapping, searching and discovering, but also because it hints at a water droplet, albeit an upside down one.

## Technologies Used

##### 1. Languages

- [HTML5](https://html.com/html5/)
- [CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets)
- [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) - used to implement the Slick Carousel.
- [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) - simplified the use of JavaScript for the Slick Carousel.

##### 2. Integrations

Tachyons was the preferred choice of CSS Toolkit. Being far more user friendly than something like Bootstrap for example, it offers a collection of small components that can be used independently as well as mixed in with others. Using it requires very little CSS and it is fully responsive.

Other integrations include:

- [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
- [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps)

##### 3. Workspace, version control and Repository storage

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Coding Editor
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - Version Control
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) - Repository Storage
- [Imgbot](https://github.com/marketplace/imgbot) - A Github app that optimizes images (free for open source projects).
  > Imgbot sends an auto pull request with images optimized. The pull request is merged and Imgbot keeps working as changes are made to the repository.

## Testing

### [Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools)

- Throughout the development process, DevTools was used for testing responsive behaviour on small, medium and large screen sizes.
- It was also consistently used to debug and prototype CSS.

### [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/)

- Used to check that my HTML and CSS markup was in order and in line with best practice methods.

### [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse)

- Used to check performance, accessibility and SEO potential of the website.
  - Overall performance: 
  - Accessibility: 
  - Best Practices: 
  - SEO: 

### [Mobile-Friendly Test](https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly)

- Once the website was published, this site was used to check if the site was mobile-friendly.
  - Passed the test.

### [Web Page Test](https://www.webpagetest.org/)

- This site tested the website's performance.
  - Load speed:
